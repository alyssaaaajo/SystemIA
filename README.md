Database migrations help manage schema changes in a structured and version-controlled way, preventing data loss while keeping different environments in sync. They allow teams to modify the database schema incrementally, making it easier to apply updates safely. This ensures smooth transitions between different versions of the database.

GraphQL vs REST: GraphQL differs from REST by allowing clients to request only the data they need through a single endpoint, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Unlike REST, which relies on multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL provides more flexibility and efficiency in CRUD operations by enabling nested queries and batch requests in a single API call.
